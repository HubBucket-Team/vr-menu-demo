## WebVR Menu Demo

Prototype of a menu system in Virtual Reality controlled using only the user's gaze! Requires a cutting-edge browser and a Google Cardboard (or similarly compatible) device. While current browser support for native VR headsets (Vive/Oculus) is poor, it should rapidly improve in the near future. When it does, this demo should support them, too!

Enjoy!

### Running the demo locally

To run this demo yourself, simply start a static file server (e.g., with [Node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/static-server)) in the project root and navigate to `main.html` in your browser.
